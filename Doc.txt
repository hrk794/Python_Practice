4.7

It is posssible to define functions using with a variable number of arguments.
There are three forms, which can be combined.

1.  The most useful is to specify a default value for one or more arguments.

Important: 
The default value is evaluated only once. This makes a differnce when the default is mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. 
Thus, the default value is evaluated when the function is called for the first time; if it the argument is mutable, and its value is changed within the body of the function, the new value continues to exist even when the function has been completely executed and is evaluated when the function is called for the next time instead of the default value.
